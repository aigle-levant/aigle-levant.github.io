## Types of Hackers Found in Cybersecurity

### Black hat hackers

They are **unethical hackers** [or crackers] that crack systems, implant virus or malware in systems through various means, perform data breaches and attacks - typically anything that is illegal.

Their main goal is to **gain un-authorised access to a computer system** so that they can gleefully use it to fulfil their needs.

### White hat hackers

They are **ethical hackers** [or red teams, tiger teams] who identify and fix vulnerabilities in computer systems. They try to **uncover any weakness in the system** in order to strengthen it against any potential attack.

[In other words, they pretend-play the role of a black hat hacker to see the system through their mentality and then fix issues that would be seen by that]

### Grey hat hackers

They stand on the line between white and black hat hackers. They **uncover weaknesses** [such as zero-day vulnerabilities] and report them.

Unlike white hat hackers, they **demand payment in exchange for their information** and they don't usually have the permission to hack into the systems.

### Blue hat hackers

#### Non-malicious

The non-malicious variety are the **security experts** employed by companies to improve their security systems.

#### Malicious

The malicious and harmful variety **use their skilled knowledge for vengeance** against an individual, or at times an organisation.

### Purple hat hackers

These people [harmlessly] **train themselves by hacking into their own computer** from another computer they own and then assessing their hacking techniques.

### Red hat hackers

They [also known as : vigilantes] are motivated by a strong desire to **fight black hat hackers**. To fulfil their righteous rage, they infiltrate their communities on dark web and launch attacks on their networks and devices.

Be warned : They are aggressive and don't mind using equally aggressive tactics such as destroying computers.

### Green hat hackers

They are **inexperienced amateurs** who don't have the intention to cause harm, but their inexperience causes them to 'accidentally' do so.

They love using **phishing** and **social engineering** until they gain more experience.
